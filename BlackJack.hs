-- the bank plays. The bank draws cards until its score is 16 or higher, and then it stops.

-- The value of a hand (the score) is the sum of the values of the cards. The values are as follows:

-- To write this function you will probably need to introduce a helper function that takes the deck and the bankâ€™s hand as input. To draw a card from the deck you can use where in the following way:


-- playBank :: Deck -> Hand
